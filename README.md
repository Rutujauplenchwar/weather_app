# weather_app

When the app starts, it will display the current location's weather details. There will be an icon for the city that, when clicked, opens a new screen where you can enter the name of a city and press the 'Get Weather' button to retrieve weather details for that city. Additionally, there will be a 'near_me' icon that, when pressed, will refresh and display the current location's weather details.
